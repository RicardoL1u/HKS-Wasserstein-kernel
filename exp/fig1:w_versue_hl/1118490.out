Generating WKS embeddings by <function get_sample4WKS at 0x2ad3d0035940> with w=0.15000000000000002 for PTC_MR.
with hlen = 800, C = 1 and gammas = 10
Kernel matrices computed.

Running SVMs, crossvalidation: False, gridsearch: False.
Final accuracy: 65.714 %
No results saved to file as --crossvalidation or --gridsearch were not selected.
