TODO
1. the way to sample points on hks could be improved / no simply random
2. how to combined the node attribution with the hks
    > now we only utilize the structure info of one given graph
   (maybe we could changing our problem setting? / Find Graph data without node attribution)
3. improve the Wasserstein distance -> no simply regard the probability of each node as 1/n 
   (find one way measure the importance of each node in the graph)
4. simply sum all the energy flow centred node a may not be a wise way
   It is natural the energy flow between different pairs of nodes have
   different meaning
